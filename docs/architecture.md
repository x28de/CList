# CList Architecture

CList is a personal learning and communications application: a browser-based tool for reading feeds, writing content, publishing to social platforms, and chatting with peers. It has **no server-side logic of its own** — all files are static HTML/CSS/JS that can be served from any web host, or run directly as a local desktop application. The instance at `clist.mooc.ca` is one deployment; any user can host their own copy at any URL, or run it offline.

Every feature that requires a back end delegates to one of the purpose-built services described below.

---

## Learning workflow

CList is organized around a single core activity: the cycle of reading, responding, and connecting that constitutes learning. The intended workflow is:

**Read** — find items worth responding to in the feeds you follow.  
**Annotate** — mark what is significant and why, as you read.  
**Synthesize** — load selected items into the editor and compose a response.  
**Publish** — send that response back out to the places your readers are.

Every major component maps to a step in this cycle. The two-pane layout keeps reading and writing visible simultaneously. The annotation system records understanding as it forms, linked to the source material. The editor supports loading multiple items as the basis for a single composed response. The publish system reaches multiple platforms in one action.

The ambition is to make this cycle fast enough that it becomes natural — not a workflow requiring a tool switch, but one that happens in the margin of reading.

### Annotations as a core learning practice

An annotation is more than a bookmark. It is the moment a reader becomes a writer: the decision that something is worth noting, the formulation of why, and the first draft of a response. CList's annotation system is built around this premise:

- Annotations are stored on a server you control, identified by your DID — not on a third-party platform you must remain on.
- Followed users' annotations appear alongside yours when you view an item — turning a private act into a lightweight social one.
- "Flowing" (re-annotating with attribution) is the native gesture for saying "this is worth passing on" — distinct from a like, because it requires formulation.

The annotation system is the part of CList that most directly distinguishes it from an RSS reader or a social client. It is the read-write interface — the seam where consuming and producing are the same act.

### Why annotations before other features

Feed reading and social posting were built first because they are the obvious necessities. But the more fundamental capability — the one that makes CList a *learning* environment rather than a communication tool — is the ability to respond to content in place: to mark *this*, right here, as what I am thinking about, and say what I think.

Without annotations, CList is a feed reader with a publish button. With them, it is a tool where reading and writing are the same activity.

---

## Decentralized design

CList is designed so that **no single server is required and no single operator controls the system**.

**CList itself is per-user.** Each person runs their own instance — a static copy of the HTML/CSS/JS files — hosted wherever they choose: a personal website, a shared server, or a local folder on their desktop. Users pick their own combination of features and service connections; there is no canonical CList server that all users must pass through.

**The supporting services are federated.** kvstore, collab, discussions, and proxyp are each designed to run as multiple independent instances operated by different people. A user connects their CList to whichever instance they trust or host themselves — for example, `kvstore.mooc.ca` or their own `kvstore.downes.ca`. CList holds the URL of each service it uses as a user-configurable setting, not a hardcoded constant.

**There are no required bottlenecks.** Feed reading, writing, and publishing to social platforms all work without any of the optional services. The services that do exist (kvstore for credentials, collab for shared editing, discussions for peer discovery) are swappable: a user can point their CList at a different instance of any service, or run their own. The goal is a system that remains free and accessible even if any individual server goes offline or changes its terms.

## Two-pane layout

The interface is split horizontally between a **read pane** (left) and a **write pane** (right). Each pane has a matching **options pane** that slides in from the edge of the screen. A floating `#statusPane` at the bottom shows transient feedback.

The left pane holds the feed reader and (optionally) the P2P chat or audio section. The right pane holds the active editor. Both panes have command bars, account lists, and pre-declared panels that are shown/hidden on demand.

See `ui_components.md` for the full div tree, CSS classes, and JS helpers for building panels and lists.

## Features

### Feed reading

The **Read** button opens an account list. Selecting a read-enabled account calls `switchReaderAccount()` in `reader.js`, which dispatches entirely through the registry — it has no knowledge of individual service types:

```js
const handler = window.CList.readers[accountData.type];
await handler.initialize(accountData);
```

`setupFeedButtons()` in `interface.js` reads `handler.feedFunctions` and renders the feed-type buttons. Feed items are rendered into `#feed-container` by each service's own fetch functions.

The full reader handler shape:

```js
window.CList.readers['MyService'] = {
    initialize:    async (accountData) => { /* connect, load first feed */ },
    feedFunctions: { 'Timeline': fn, 'Bookmarks': fn, … },  // rendered as buttons
    onFeedClick:   (item) => { /* navigate to item's feed */ },     // or null
    onAuthorClick: (item) => { /* navigate to author's profile */ },// or null
    statusActions: (item, itemID, itemUrl) => htmlString,           // or null
};
```

`initialize(accountData)` receives the full parsed account object — `accountData.instance`, `accountData.id`, `accountData.type`, etc. — and is responsible for extracting whatever credentials or URLs it needs.

Services register reader handlers via `window.CList.readers`. See `feed-structure.md` for DOM conventions and `adding-a-service.md` for the full registration pattern.

### Writing and editing

The write pane hosts a pluggable set of editors. Active editors are registered in `editorHandlers` (a module-level object in `editors.js`), each providing `initialize`, `getContent`, `loadContent`, `setFocus`, `draftKey`, and optional `destroy` methods. The editor chooser (right pane) switches between editors while preserving draft content. Auto-save writes draft content to localStorage on each change.

See `editors_structure.md` for the full contract, the `pendingContent` hand-off flow, and how load and save handlers interact with the editor.

### Publishing

The **Post** button opens an account list of write-enabled accounts (`window.CList.accounts`). Clicking **Publish** calls `postAll()` in `publish.js`, which:

1. Collects the title and editor content as HTML.
2. Sorts selected accounts by `maxlength` (unlimited first).
3. For each account, optionally calls `handler.construct()` to build the measured text, checks the character limit, then calls `handler.publish()` — passing a URL returned by an earlier account to short-form accounts.

Services register publish handlers via `window.CList.publishers`. Built-in targets: Mastodon, Bluesky, WordPress, Blogger.

See `publish_structure.md` for the full contract, `construct()`, the `accountData` shape, and the URL-referencing behaviour. See `adding-a-service.md` for the broader registry pattern.

### Saving and loading

The **Save** and **Load** buttons open lists built from `window.CList.savers` and `window.CList.loaders` — plain arrays of `{ label, icon, save/load }` objects. Any service can push a saver or loader without a named registry key. Load handlers return `{ type: 'text/html'|'text/plain', value }` or `null`; the editor's `loadContent()` handles format conversion.

### P2P chat

The **Chat** button opens a peer discovery list populated from `discussions.mooc.ca`. Selecting a discussion connects via PeerJS/WebRTC. CList users form a full mesh with each other; `chat.html` users connect to one CList user who relays messages to the rest.

Chat messages can be signed with the user's Ed25519 identity key and verified against their DID document. Message deduplication (a `processedMsgIds` Set) prevents relay loops.

See `p2p-chat.md` for the full WebRTC lifecycle, hub-and-spoke topology explanation, DID signing, and relay logic.

### Decentralized identity (DID)

Each user can generate an Ed25519 identity key in the browser. The private key is encrypted with their AES-GCM `encKey` and stored as the `_did_identity_key` system KV entry in kvstore — the server never sees it. The public key is registered at `/auth/did` and assembled by kvstore into a `did:web` document at `https://kvstore.mooc.ca/users/{username}/did.json`.

The DID document links the user's social accounts as verifiable service endpoints and includes a `did:key` alias in `alsoKnownAs` for systems that prefer it.

See `identity-did.md` for the full document structure, key rotation, portability between kvstore instances, and the did:dht upgrade path.

### Collaborative editing

The **Collab** editor connects to `collab.mooc.ca` via a Hocuspocus WebSocket. Multiple users editing the same document ID are synchronized in real time via Yjs CRDTs. Documents are namespaced `{username}/{slug}`; the namespace owner creates, anyone may join. Presence (who is currently editing) is shown via the Yjs awareness protocol.

Documents can be shared as read-only or editable links at `collab.mooc.ca/doc/{id}/read` or `/edit`.

See `project_collab.md` in the memory directory for integration status, and the collab app's `CLAUDE.md` for the server API and database schema.

### AI features

`chatgpt.js`, `summarize.js`, and `translate.js` provide AI-powered writing assistance. These call external AI APIs directly from the browser, with credentials stored in kvstore like any other account.

## Back-end services

CList is client-side only. The services below provide the infrastructure it relies on.

### kvstore — credential store and identity provider

**Domain:** `kvstore.mooc.ca` | **Stack:** Python/Flask | **Container:** `kvstore:5000`

Stores per-user encrypted KV entries. The server holds only ciphertext; encryption and decryption happen in the browser using a key derived from the user's password (PBKDF2 + AES-GCM). The server never sees the password or the encryption key.

On login, kvstore issues a signed **ES256 JWT** (30-day expiry). Remote services verify the JWT locally by fetching the JWKS endpoint (`/.well-known/jwks.json`) — no callback to kvstore needed at request time.

kvstore also hosts DID documents (`/users/{username}/did.json`) assembled from stored public keys and social account metadata.

See `identity-did.md` for the DID layer and `accounts-structure.md` for how CList reads and writes account credentials.

### proxyp — cross-domain proxy

**Domain:** `proxyp.mooc.ca` | **Stack:** Perl/PSGI | **Container:** `proxyp:8081`

Forwards GET and POST requests from the browser to external APIs, adding CORS headers on the response. This allows CList to reach services that do not support CORS directly. Accepts only `http(s)` URLs with a proper hostname — no bare IPs, no localhost.

### discussions — peer discovery and signaling

**Domain:** `discussions.mooc.ca` | **Stack:** Python/Flask | **Container:** `discussions:8082`

A bulletin board for P2P chat. CList users POST their PeerJS peer ID and a discussion name; other users GET the list to find active discussions. Entries expire after 5 minutes without a heartbeat; the CList client re-POSTs every 60 seconds. Auth via kvstore JWT.

No chat content passes through this server — it is only used to exchange peer IDs before WebRTC connections are established.

### collab — collaborative editing server

**Domain:** `collab.mooc.ca` | **Stack:** Node.js 20 / Hocuspocus v2 / Yjs | **Container:** `collab:3003`

Real-time collaborative editing over WebSocket. Hocuspocus handles Yjs CRDT sync; SQLite persists document state between sessions. Documents without an owner can permit anonymous (read-only) access. Auth via kvstore JWT passed in the WebSocket token.

See `/srv/apps/collab/CLAUDE.md` for the REST API, document ID conventions, and the database schema.

### opml2json — feed aggregation

**Domain:** `opml2json.downes.ca` | **Stack:** Python/Flask | **Container:** `opml2json-opml2json-1:8000`

Converts OPML subscription lists to JSON and aggregates RSS feeds on request. Used by CList's feed reader to parse OPML files and retrieve feed content.

---

## Application namespace

All shared state and registries live under a single `window.CList` object, declared in `index.html` before any other script runs:

```js
window.CList = {
    config:     { flaskSiteUrl: 'https://kvstore.mooc.ca' },  // mutable; overridden by localStorage or launcher
    state:      { username: 'none', references: [] },          // updated on login/logout; references cleared on new composition
    accounts:   [],                                            // decrypted account list; populated after login
    schemas:    {},                                            // keyed by service type → account form definition
    readers:    {},                                            // keyed by service type → reader handler
    publishers: {},                                            // keyed by service type → publish handler
    savers:     [],                                            // ordered array of save-to destinations
    loaders:    [],                                            // ordered array of load-from sources
    ui:         {},                                            // DOM helpers and view references (ui.js)
    keys: {
        ACCESS_TOKEN:          'access_token',          // kvstore auth token (site-specific cookie)
        USERNAME:              'username',              // logged-in username (site-specific cookie)
        TOKEN_EXPIRES:         'token_expires',         // token expiry timestamp (site-specific cookie)
        OAUTH_CALLBACK_RESULT: 'oauth_callback_result', // OAuth popup result (localStorage)
        KVSTORE_URL:           'clist_kvstore_url',     // selected kvstore server URL (localStorage)
    },
};
```

### config

`config.flaskSiteUrl` is the URL of the user's kvstore instance. It is set to the default (`https://kvstore.mooc.ca`) at page load, then overridden in priority order by:

1. `localStorage.getItem('clist_kvstore_url')` — persisted user preference
2. `window._launcherConfig.kvstoreUrl` — injected by the desktop launcher via `runtime-config.js`

`kvstore.js` writes the final value back to localStorage when the user changes it in the Change Server panel.

### state

`state.username` is the logged-in username string, or `'none'` when no user is logged in. It is set by `kvstore.js` from the site-specific cookie on login and cleared to `''` on logout.

`state.references` is the array of source items loaded into the editor for the current composition — feed items, annotations, or collections the user has chosen to respond to. Managed by `references.js` via `pushReference()`, `clearReferences()`, and `getReferences()`. Used by `publish.js` to pass reply context to publishers (Mastodon, Bluesky) and trigger webmentions.

### accounts

`accounts` is the decrypted array of the logged-in user's service credentials. Each entry has the shape `{ key: string, value: JSON-string }` where `value` decodes to `{ type, instance, id, permissions, title, public }`. It is populated by `getAccounts()` after login and cleared to `[]` on logout.

See `accounts-structure.md` for the full storage format, `parseAccountValue()`, and the conventions for the `permissions` and `maxlength` fields.

---

## Account system

All credentials are stored in kvstore as AES-GCM encrypted blobs. At runtime, CList decrypts them into `window.CList.accounts`. Each entry has a `type` field that routes it to the correct service handler.

The Accounts panel is driven by `window.CList.schemas` — one entry per service type, defining the form fields and their labels, input types, and defaults.

See `accounts-structure.md` for the full storage format, `parseAccountValue()`, and the conventions for the `permissions` and `maxlength` fields.

---

## Registry pattern

Services are wired in at load time by populating five registries on `window.CList`:

| Registry | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `window.CList.schemas` | Drives the Accounts panel form |
| `window.CList.publishers` | Called by `postAll()` to send content to a platform |
| `window.CList.readers` | Called by Read to initialize a session and offer feed views |
| `window.CList.savers` | Array of save destinations shown in the Save pane |
| `window.CList.loaders` | Array of load sources shown in the Load pane |

Each service lives in one file (`js/myservice.js`), loaded via `index.html` before `interface.js`. All registrations use the safe-init pattern (the namespace is guaranteed to exist before any service script runs):

```js
window.CList.readers['MyService'] = { ... };
window.CList.schemas['MyService'] = { ... };
```

See `adding-a-service.md` for the full pattern and `publish_structure.md` for the publish handler contract.

---

## Error handling

All user-visible errors go through two helpers in `ui.js` (aliased to globals at the bottom of that file):

- **`showServiceError(container, title, message, actionHtml?)`** — persistent red banner for hard failures (feed loads, API errors, missing credentials).
- **`showStatusMessage(text)`** — transient message in `#statusPane`, auto-hides after 3 seconds. For action feedback, validation, and background results.

`alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` are never used. `innerHTML` is never set with peer-supplied or server-supplied data.

See `error-handling.md` for the full rules, context-specific guidance (P2P chat, standalone pages), and the CSS classes for error display.

---

## JS module load order

Scripts are loaded via `index.html` with `defer`. All deferred scripts execute in document order before `DOMContentLoaded` fires, so by the time `kvstore.js`'s `DOMContentLoaded` handler runs (checking login state, populating accounts), every service file has already registered its handlers.

The `window.CList` namespace is declared in an inline `<script>` in `<head>` before any deferred script loads, so service files can write directly to `window.CList.readers`, `window.CList.schemas`, etc. — no defensive initialization needed, and registration order among service files does not matter.

The following ordering constraints do apply:

| Constraint | Why |
|---|---|
| `utilities.js` first | `showStatusMessage`, `parseAccountValue`, `escapeHtml` are called by every other module |
| `crypto_utils.js` before `kvstore.js` | `kvstore.js` calls `deriveEncKey` / `deriveAuthHash` |
| `kvstore.js` before service files | Service files call `getSiteSpecificCookie`, `getAccounts`, `loginRequired` — all defined in `kvstore.js` |
| `interface.js` last | Reads from all registries and wires up the full UI; handlers registered after it runs would be invisible |
